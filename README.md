# Adding users to teams team with PoweShell

For a reason there was need to add users from .txt file to teams group. 
I am sharing here my implementation. It is not perfect but works. 
In order to use it you need to just put users emails inside `emails.txt`, install
[Teams Cmdlets module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftTeams/1.0.2),
change according settings inside  `addTeamsUser.ps1` with your credentials,
click with right button of the mouse on `addTeamsUser.ps1` and choose `Run with powershell`
from the context menu. Enjoy!
